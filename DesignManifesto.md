## Design Manifesto
### Introduction
After the six design sprints in this class I have come up with a defined design process.  My process is, brainstorming, refining, prototyping, testing, and a final polish.  This class has afforded me several opportunities to practice and refine my design process.  In the future I believe that this class will have had a strong influence on how I go about my designs.  In this manifesto I will discuss why I have chosen these five steps as part of my design process.  

### Brainstorming

My design process begins with a brainstorm.  Putting ideas down on paper is the best way to get started with the design process.  With each of the design sprints this term my group began our project with a paper and pencil brainstorm.

This brainstorm promotes free thinking and helped each of my groups come up with what was eventually our final product.  I always like to write things down, for me, writing something down helps me think about it and makes me consider what it means.   Brainstorming gives you a chance to think through the entire project and work out what message you want to convey.  Before I begin brainstorming for any project I start by reading the prompt very carefully and discussing what it means with my partners or peers.  

It is very important to have a goal in mind when you start brainstorming.  Without a goal for your project you have no direction for you to begin your brainstorm in.  For the final design sprint in the class, design for another world, we were given an open ended project with no goal set from the beginning.  Without a goal it is hard to know where to begin, my group decided our goal first, and then started brainstorming ideas for our design.  We decided to use humor to convey what it is like to live in messenger hall above the Foise Innovation Studio.  

### Refining
My second step for any design is refine the ideas I put into my brainstorm.  In this stage my goal is to narrow down the ideas I got from brainstorming and decide what I want to test and prototype.  This stage was crucial in the design for understanding project.  After our brainstorm we had a ton of ideas for how we wanted to convey our message.  We refined our ideas at this stage using a [five design sheet](http://fds.design/).  I really liked using these as they allowed us to put our messy brainstorm ideas down in a very neat thorough format.  Using these design sheets helped us narrow down what we thought would and would not work.   It is important in this stage to keep several working ideas going.  I believe that this stage is about exploring what the most feasible option is for your first prototype.

### Prototyping

The prototyping stage is key for testing all the little mechanics of your design.  I really appreciated doing the paper prototypes in the design for others project and felt that it was a key step in our design process.  Prototyping is so important to the design process because it is the moment where your design takes shape.  From paper prototypes to full builds this stage is key.

Learning to use the tools for your design can be a big hindrance to this part of the design process.  In my design for wellbeing project, no members of my group, myself included, had any experience with javascript.  This made the project difficult and required a lot of trial and error as well as research to complete on time.  This of course was all part of the prototyping process and helped us understand what would and would not work for our final product.
	
### Testing
The testing phase requires a lot of time and patience.  In this class I learned several steps that are key to good user testing.  The first thing I learned is that you have to let the user figure things out on their own.  This step only works if your design has good instructions and the user is able to work out what they need to do from those.  Part of your test of course could be about whether or not your instructions are clear enough or if your design conveys its message well.  It is also important to ask users for feedback on the design.  User feedback can be anything from a critique of your design to feedback on how it made them feel.  

User testing was key for the project design for wellbeing.  This project used affectiva to recognize the users emotions.  When we tested our design users were consistently confused and didnâ€™t know what the goal of the design was.  We had missed this key element in our design and user testing highlighted the issue and helped us find a workable solution.  This problem taught me that each design should require minimal explanation to get started, or at least have easy to follow instructions.

### Final Polish
After user testing I think there should be a final polish made to your design.  In this stage you should take the feedback you got from testing and try to solve the issues users found with your design.  It is important to understand what the feedback you got means in order to use it effectively to tweak your design.  Polishing was key in the design for understanding project and made our final product look very polished and organized.

### Conclusion
Each step of my design process is crucial to creating good designs.  Brainstorming get key ideas and uses goals to find your message.  Refining those ideas brings clarity to your design and helps you narrow down your ideas for your prototyping phase.  The prototyping phase is where all those ideas start to come together.  In your testing phase you get to see your work in action.  In the final polishing phase you refine your prototype and use your feedback from the testing phase.  I believe that without any one of these steps my design would be far less successful and would feel incomplete.
