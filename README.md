### [See my manifesto here.](https://elizabethkirschner.github.io/CS3041DesignManifesto/DesignManifesto) 

Hi! I'm Elizabeth Kirschner, I a second year student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute pursuing a double major in computer science and interactive media & game development.  This website contains a portfolio of my work in CS 3041, Human Computer Interaction, and a design manifesto detailing the design process I developed over the course of the term.

All of the projects below were a collaborative effort and reflect group work.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/elizabethkirschner/CS3041DesignManifesto/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/elizabethkirschner/CS3041DesignManifesto/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
